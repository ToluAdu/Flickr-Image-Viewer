# Flickr-Image-Viewer
Created a third-party dynamic data viewing Android application using the Flickr API.
Users are able to navigate through a custom designed UI with animated transitions to view images. The application makes use of notifications and dialogues such as a spinning progress widget when network activities are taking place and supports a refresh button to load new images, a sharing button to share content between other applications such as Email, a navigation drawer to enhance accessibility and a search function utilising API calls.
